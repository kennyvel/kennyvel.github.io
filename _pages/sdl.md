## ITP 380

Overview:

Multiple games made using SDL/SDL2 with starter code provided for some from class. Over the course of the semester, games built off of code from games made previously.  

The games done as part of the class include Pong, Asteroids, Frogger, Mario, Pac-Man, Zelda, Star Fox Tunnel, Mario Kart, and Runnerâ€™s Edge (a first person 3D platformer). Another game, Robotron 2084, was also recreated and simplified using the same code base built up from this class for the final exam of another class (ITP 481) later in the future. This class was my first exposure to programming for video games and helped me learn some of the basics for game programming as well as maintaining good code quality. 

Throughout the labs, we focused on using a component model for things like movement and sprites while also having the ability to override functions if need be in our game object class, Actor

Here is a short video that shows clips of the assignments done in class, with the exception of Portal being a recent replacement to Runner's Edge:
