Hello, I’m Kenny

I’m a USC graduate currently residing in California that is passionable about implementing features in video games and web applications. Applying what I've learned in class to games and web applications was the way I started to enjoy coding in college, as projects became less soulless and more applicable to what is around me. In my free time I mainly read manga, go to the gym, play video games with friends, and practice to compete at a higher level in Apex Legends.

Game(s) currently in my rotation:

Apex Legends and World of Warcraft (Retail)

What I'm currently reading:

'Blue Box', 'Medalist', and 'Hope You're Happy, Lemon'
