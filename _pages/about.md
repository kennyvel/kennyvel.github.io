Hello, I’m Kenny

I’m a USC graduate currently residing in Calfornia, born and raised in SoCal. Learning to code for games is how I grew to enjoy coding throughout college while getting beat down by my other boring requirements 

In my free time, I mainly watch anime, read manga, go to the gym, and play video games with friends. 

Top 3 manga/anime:

Land of the Lustrous, March Comes in like a Lion, Freiren: Beyond Journey’s End

Game(s) I currently grind:

Apex Legends and Valorant
