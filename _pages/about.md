Hello, I’m Kenny

I’m a USC graduate currently residing in Calfornia, born and raised in SoCal. Learning to code for games is how I grew to enjoy coding throughout college while getting beat down by my other boring requirements. 

In my free time I mainly read manga, go to the gym, play video games with friends, and practice to compete at a higher level in Apex Legends.

Top 3 manga:

Land of the Lustrous, March Comes in like a Lion, Freiren: Beyond Journey’s End

Game(s) currently in my rotation:

Apex Legends, World of Warcraft, and Marvel Rivals
